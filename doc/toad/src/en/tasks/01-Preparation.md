[brief description]    


## Goal

[presentation of the objective of the method]


## Minimal requirements


- Diffusion images (dwi)
- Anatommical images (anat)
- Gradient vector (b or bvec and bval)


## Implementation

```
[If only one step, do not add the subtitle step 1]
```

### [1- Produce encoding directions]

```
[Tool or function used with the reference to the official documentation]
```

### [2- Force re-orientation]

```
[Tool or function used with the reference to the official documentation]
```

### [3- Check Freesurfer folder if exist]

```
[Tool or function used with the reference to the official documentation]
```

## Expected result(s) - Quality Assessment (QA)

[what should be produced by TOAD, the expected output]
