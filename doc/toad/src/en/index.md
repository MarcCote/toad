# TOolkit d’Analyse de Diffusion (TOAD)

Welcome to the English version of the documentation of [TOAD](toad.com).
Sources files as well as installation’s instructionLes are available on [Github](www.github.com/toad).

TOAD offers a pipeline to automatically preprocessed diffusion imaging data (DTI).
The different steps allow to:

1. Clean the data
2. Prepare the different masks to be used (white matter, grey matter...)
3. Extract the main fibers
4. Extract the main metrics (FA, MD...)

This website will guide you to start using TOAD [(tutorial)](tutorial) and also a more comprehensive documentation about each step followed by TOAD.
